### Task Day: 3

1. How to compare two JSON have the same properties but different order?
2. Use the rest countries API URL: https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all and display all the country flags in the console?
3. Use the same rest countries and print all countries name, region, subregion and population?

# Note: 
## For question 1:
Refer equalJson.js file in the repo. Output of the logic will be displayed in the console. 
## For question 2 and 3:
Refer index.html, there I created a table that lists all the countries name, region, subregion, population and flag also.
